# Graphview

*A simple app to rotate full-screen graphs on a systems monitoring display*

Inspired by [CactiView](https://github.com/lozzd/cactiview), Graphview
runs entirely in the browser, and provides graph image preloading to
avoid progressive loading annoyance on slow connections.

Supports displaying graphs from Cacti and Graphite, iframes (like New
Relic), as well showing the time and the Jenkins build status (coming soon).
